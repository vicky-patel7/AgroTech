        <h4>Finding ways to increase the efficiency of irrigation systems is key for farmers across the globe who want
            to
            enhance their sustainability. There are lots of potential ways farmers can conserve water, energy, and money
            if
            they have the right equipment or software. The irrigation technology that’s become available in recent years
            can
            help farmers manage their water use more efficiently.</h4>
        </p>
        <b>And here comes the idea of <em> DRIP IRRIGATION </em> which has its advantages in each possible way.</b>
    </div>
    <br>

    <head>
        <i><b>Overview</b></i>
        <p>
            Drip irrigation, a system in which water is frequently and slowly applied directly to the crop root zone.
            The concept of this irrigation is to irrigate only the root zone instead of the entire field surface, thus
            making the water content of the crop zone at the optimal level. With efficiency above 90%, the drip
            irrigation method is transforming the lives of millions of farmers across the globe, enabling farmers to get
            higher yields while serving water fertilizer and energy.

        <i><b>Reason to adopt this method of irrigation...</b></i>
        <p>
            The main reason to adopt this method of irrigation is not only efficiency but also its water
            conservativeness, less human effort, energy savings, less weather dependency, and many such…….
            From a human aspect, no one would like to eat a meal at a time for a month quota. So why plants? Just think
            if plants too get their supply on a regular and balanced basis, they must give us more worth. Which is why
            drip irrigation applies to water and nutrients frequently and in small doses, ensuring optimal growing
            condition that helps produce highest possible yields.

    <head>
        <i><b>Not to forget the biggest problem</b></i>
        <p>
            Freshwater supply is constant, especially good quality that can also be used for drinking purposes but being
            used for irrigation too. Therefore, this resource will need to be deployed and used wisely to meet the
            increasing demands of production. Irrigation accounts for 4/5 of the total consumption of freshwater. And
            this demand goes generally high in semi-arid and arid areas.
        </p>
    </head>
    <p>
        The drip irrigation system can be made more clearer when divided into its subcategories according to quantity
        and rate of water discharge:
        1. Point-source emitters (drip bubbler)
        2. In-line emitter
        3. Basin Bubblers
        4. Micro spray sprinkler
        As already mentioned, the method efficiency is above 90%. This only result of its two factors:
        - Irrigating the crop by drop method allows the soil to soak it before it gets evaporates.
        - Water is applied to the crop root zone where it is needed the most.
    </p>
    <br>

    <head>
        <i><b>Why drip irrigation?....</b></i>
        <p>
            Drip irrigation provides water to plants as their requirement which creates no runoff and offers very little
            evapotranspiration. By using this system, a farmer can ensure good water management. Some other benefits
            which also can’t be ignored: -
            - Crops can be irrigated immediately when soil moisture drops below a threshold.
            - Fertilizers and pesticides can be given to crop along with irrigation.
            - Reduced weed growth
            - Irrigation can be stopped at any moment which prevents overirrigation
            - Easy to implement on any agricultural land type.
            This all can be more enhanced when we use some sensors technology like moisture-controlling sensors,
            over-irrigation alert sensors, auto-cut irrigation sensors at a specific point, and time sensors.

        <i><b>Limitation</b></i>
        <p>
            - Damaged plastic pipes caused by rodents
            - Plants are more susceptible to stress if drip irrigation fails
            - Clogging of emitters, caused by soil particles, chemicals, fertilizers, or organic materials

        </p>
    </head>

    <head>
        <i><b>Conclusion</b></i>
        <p>
            Besides these limitations, DRIP IRRIGATION provides much more benefits to the farmers and enhances
            productivity. It also saves plenty of drinkable water through its methodology of applying water at the time
            when plants need it and in rates needed for proper plant growth. Moreover, it provides a very favorable
            moisture level in the soil in which plants can flourish.
            In the advent of modern technology and subsequent applied research towards the irrigation of plants, this
            method of irrigation is the most suitable one for the judicious distribution of watering the plants.
